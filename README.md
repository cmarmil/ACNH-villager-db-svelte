A web application that displays Animal Crossing New Horizons villagers by species or search term. Villagers can be favorited to create a 'Dreamies' list that is saved via local storage. 
I created this as a quick excercise to learn the basics of Svelte, and dropped in Bulma to help impliment a clean UI. Villager data is graciously provided by https://github.com/alexislours/ACNHAPI.
